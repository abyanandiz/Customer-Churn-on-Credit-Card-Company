# Customer-Churn-on-Credit-Card-Company
AGIT Technical Test

# Context
Recently, a credit card company named ABC encounter challenges in which many of customers have stopped using their
services. Data scientists being asked to create a predictive model to predict which customers will churn so the company
can provide early additional services for those customers in the hope that customers will change their minds and do not
stop using the company ABC credit card services.

Given dataset : ‘churn_train’ and ‘churn_test’ which you can find in dataset ZIP file >> folder ‘Python & ML’.
Notes : CLIENTNUM is unique customer number and Churn_Flag is the target

# Question
Please create a machine learning model using python to predict whether customer is churn (1) or not (0),
Following criteria below:

- Data pre-processing [Handling missing data or outliers or imbalanced class or others.] ( 3 marks ).
- Training classification ML using at least 1 algorithm [Logistic Regression or Decision Tree, etc.] ( 3 marks ).
- Evaluate model performance using confusion matrix and explain the model precision and recall ( 2 marks ).
- Please create prediction csv using from ‘churn_test’ data( 2 marks ).
